# Reddit Bot: *botdessert*

## Who am I supporting? 
This bot is supporting Joe Biden and opposes Donald Trump.

## Favorite Thread on Reddit
<img src=redditthread.png />

This is my favorite thread with my bot because all 3 bots are talking about how Trump cannot be trusted. 
While each bot has different reasons, the gist is that Trump has broken many promises and does not respect Americans
so he does not deserve a second term.
